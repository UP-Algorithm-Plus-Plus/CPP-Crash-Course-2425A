# C++ Crash Course Week 1 Part 1 ~ Introduction & Asking for Help

## Introduction to Week 1

Welcome to **Week 1** of the C++ Crash Course! This week is designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of C++ programming. Whether you're completely new to programming or transitioning from another language, this week will lay the groundwork for your journey ahead.

### Topics We'll Cover:

- **Introduction to C++**: Understanding what C++ is and where it's used.
- **Basic Structure of a C++ Program**: Learning about headers, namespaces, and the `main()` function.
- **Variables and Data Types**: Exploring how to declare and use different data types like `int`, `double`, `char`, `bool`, and `std::string`.
- **Input/Output Operations**: Using `std::cout` and `std::cin` to interact with the console.
- **Arithmetic Operators**: Performing calculations using operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.
- **Arrays**: Storing and accessing sequences of data.
- **Conditional Statements**: Making decisions in your code with `if`, `else if`, and `else`.
- **Loops**: Repeating actions using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
- **Functions**: Creating reusable blocks of code to perform specific tasks.

### What We Expect from You:

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- **Complete the Lectures**: Go through all the provided materials and understand the concepts.
- **Answer Knowledge Check Questions**: Test your understanding by answering review questions.
- **Do All the Assignments**: Apply what you've learned by completing coding tasks.
- **Ask Questions When Needed**: Don't hesitate to seek help if you're stuck.

Remember, programming is a skill best learned by doing. So, make sure to type out the examples, experiment with the code, and tackle the assignments proactively.

## How to Ask for Help

Learning to program can be challenging, and it's perfectly normal to have questions or need assistance. Asking for help is an essential part of the learning process. This guide will help you formulate your questions effectively to get the most helpful responses.

### Before You Ask:

1. **Attempt to Solve It Yourself**:

   - **Read Error Messages Carefully**: They often contain clues about what's wrong.
   - **Check the Documentation**: Refer back to the course materials or official C++ documentation.
   - **Simplify the Problem**: Try to isolate the issue by breaking down your code into smaller parts.
   - **Use Debugging Techniques**: Insert `std::cout` statements to check the values of variables at different points.

2. **Search for Similar Problems**:

   - **Online Resources**: Websites like Stack Overflow, GeeksforGeeks, or Cplusplus.com can be invaluable.

### Crafting Your Question:

1. **Be Specific and Clear**:

   - **Describe the Issue**: Clearly explain what you're trying to do and what's not working.
   - **Include Error Messages**: If applicable, provide the exact error messages you're receiving.
   - **State What You've Tried**: List the solutions you've already attempted.

2. **Provide Context**:

   - **Share Relevant Code**: Include the portion of code that's causing the issue. Avoid sharing your entire program unless necessary.

3. **Format Your Question Properly**:

   - **Use Code Formatting Tools**: To make your code readable, use tools like [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) or [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and share your error codes via [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/).
   - **Check for Typos**: Proofread your question to ensure clarity.

### How to Contact the Lecturer:

- **Email**: You can reach out to the lecturer of the week (Nelson) via his SimpleLogin email **simplelogin.agreement408@aleeas.com**
- **Discord**: You can also ping the lecturer via Discord or send them a direct message!
- **Anonymous Emailing**: If you prefer to remain anonymous, consider using [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/) to create an anonymous email address for you to be able to annonymously email the lecturer.

### Recommended Tools:

- **Code Sharing**:

  - **Carbon**: Create and share aesthetically pleasing images of your code.
  - **Pastebin**: Share longer code snippets or entire files.
  - **GitHub Gist**: Easily share code with version control.

- **Anonymous Email**:

  - **SimpleLogin**: Protect your identity while reaching out for help.
