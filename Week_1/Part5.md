# C++ Crash Course Week 1 Part 5 ~ C++ Basics

#### Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

**For Loop Example**:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    std::cout << "Loop iteration: " << i << std::endl;
}
```

**While Loop Example**:
```cpp
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    std::cout << "While loop iteration: " << i << std::endl;
    i++;
}
```

#### Functions

Functions group code into reusable blocks. Hereâ€™s how to define and use them:

```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int sum = add(5, 3);
    std::cout << "Sum is: " << sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

1. Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.
2. Create a program that takes in a student's score and prints their letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).
3. Write a program that asks for the user's age and tells them if they are eligible to vote (18 or older).

Your first C++ program!

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `#include <iostream>`: Includes the standard input/output stream library.
- `int main()`: Entry point of the program.
- `std::cout`: Outputs data to the console.
- `std::endl`: Inserts a newline character and flushes the stream.

### Basic Input/Output

Taking user input and displaying output.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int number;
    std::cin >> number;
    std::cout << "You entered: " << number << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Variables and Data Types

*Explain different data types (`int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`, etc.) and how to declare variables.*

---

## Operators

- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Relational Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- **Bitwise Operators**: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`

*Provide examples for each type.*

## Control Structures

### Conditional Statements

**If-Else Statement**

```cpp
if (condition) {
    // code block
} else {
    // code block
}
```

### Loops

- **For Loop**

  ```cpp
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      // code block
  }
  ```

- **While Loop**

  ```cpp
  while (condition) {
      // code block
  }
  ```

- **Do-While Loop**

  ```cpp
  do {
      // code block
  } while (condition);
  ```

---

## Functions

*How to declare and define functions, pass parameters, and return values.*

```cpp
return_type function_name(parameter_list) {
    // code block
}
```
