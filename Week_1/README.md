## C++ Basics

### Intro to C++

#### Parts of Basic C++ Code

At its core, every C++ program contains a structure similar to this:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>                       // Preprocessor directive/Library
using namespace std;                           // Makes the program use the "Standard Namespace"

int main() {                                   // The main function where execution starts
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;           // Print statement
    return 0;                                  // End the program
}
```

**Breakdown**:
- `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This imports the library for every function you would need. Functions like the math functions, input/output functions, algorithms, string handling, etc.
- `using napespace std;`: This makes it so that you don't need to type `cout` and `endl` as `std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::end;`, its useful for simple/small programs, but not so much in larger programs as it might result in conflicts with other namespaces. 
- `int main()`: Every C++ program must have a `main` function, which is where the program starts executing.
- `cout`: Outputs data to the console. In this case, it's "Hello, World!" 
- `return 0`: Signals the end of the program.

#### Assignment
1. Try programming in C++ by copying the "Hello, World!" C++ program (Don't Copy paste it! Type it, so that you start building muscle memory.) and change "Hello, World!" to "Welcome to C++!" Then run it!
2. Modify what you did in #1 by adding another print statement that prints your name instead of "Hello, World!" After that, try and run your program!

#### Input/Output

**Input** allows users to provide data, and **output** displays the results. In C++:
- `std::cout` is used for output.
- `std::cin` is used for input.

```cpp
#include <iostream>                                                 // Imports the library for Input/Output functions

int main() {
    int age;                                                        // Creates an integer variable called "age"
    std::cout << "Enter your age: ";                                // Prints "Enter your age:" and does not move on to the next line in the console
    std::cin >> age;                                                // Input stored in variable 'age'
    std::cout << "You are " << age << " years old." << std::endl;   // Prints "You are <inputted age> years old."
    return 0;                                                       // Signals the end of the program
}
```

When you run the code above, you are expected to see something like this in the console:
```
Enter your age: 
```

What's happening here is that the program is waiting for you to type something. Try and copy the code above (again try not to copy paste the code) and then run it, then see what happens when you type a number in the console and press enter. 

#### Variables & Arithmethic Operators

Variables are things that store specific types of data (depending on what the variable is instructed to accept). Below is a basic example of variables in C++

**Basic Variables Example**:
```cpp
int x = 5;        // Integer variable that is initiliazed with the number 5

double y;         // y is declared as an empty double variable
y = 4.2;          // y is assigned the floating number 4.2

char grade = 'A'; // Character variable that is initialized with the character "A"

```

Variables are usually written like this. Its either `<data-type> <variable-name>;` like `double y;` or `<data-type> <variable-name> = <value>;` like `int x = 5;` and `char grade = 'A'`. You can either declare an empty one like `double y;` at first and give it a value later, or you can also choose to declare a variable and initiliaze it with a value. 

There are multiple more data types in C++, here is a list of data types that you should find very useful and their descriptions:
- `int`  
  *Comment:* Stores integers (whole numbers) like `42` or `-3`.
- `float`  
  *Comment:* Stores single-precision floating-point numbers (e.g., `3.14`).
- `double` 
  *Comment:* Stores double-precision floating-point numbers, more accurate decimal number represtantion than `float`.
- `char`  
  *Comment:* Stores a single character (e.g., `'A'`, `'3'`).
- `bool`  
  *Comment:* Stores boolean values, either `true` or `false`.
- `string`
  *Comment:* Stores strings of characters like "ABCDE" for example. Can only be used if you use the `bits/stdc++.h` library or `string` or `iostream`

Now let's talk about some useful basic operators that you will be regularly using. The example below shows all of the C++ arithmethic operators. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>         // Imports the library for Input/Output functions

int main() {                // Start of C++ code: The main function
    int num1 = 10;          // Declares num1 an integer and initiliazes it with 10                                     
    int num2 = 5;           // Declares num2 an int and inits it with 5
    int output;             // Declares output an int with no initial value

    output = num1 + 3       // output = 10 + 3 = 13 (Addition)
    output = num1 - num2    // output = 10 - 5 = 5  (Substraction)
    output = num2 * 5       // output = 5 * 5 = 25  (Multiplication)
    output = num1 / 2       // output = 10 / 2 = 5  (Division)
    output = 11 % 5         // output = 11 % 5 = 1  (Returns the remainder of a division between two values)

    // Note: % is known as the modulo operator

    return 0;                   // Signals the end of the program
}
```

**Assignment**: 
1. Try and apply what you've learned so far and create a program that accepts two integer numbers A and B and prints the result of A + B, A - B, A * B, and A / B with its remainder. 

#### Arrays


**Array Example**:
```cpp
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
std::cout << numbers[0]; // Access first element
```

**Assignment**: 
1. Create a program that takes a user's name and age, and then prints a message with this information.
2. Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

**Assignment**: 
1. Write a program that declares variables of different types (e.g., `int`, `float`, `char`) and prints them.
2. Write a program that stores 5 different ages in an array and prints the average.
3. Create an array of 10 integers and print only the even numbers.

### Arrays

### Conditionals

Conditionals control the flow of a program based on certain conditions.

```cpp
int age = 20;
if (age >= 18) {
    std::cout << "You are an adult.";
} else {
    std::cout << "You are not an adult.";
}
```

**Mini-Assignments**: 
1. Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.
2. Create a program that takes in a student's score and prints their letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).
3. Write a program that asks for the user's age and tells them if they are eligible to vote (18 or older).

### Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

**For Loop Example**:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    std::cout << "Loop iteration: " << i << std::endl;
}
```

**While Loop Example**:
```cpp
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    std::cout << "While loop iteration: " << i << std::endl;
    i++;
}
```

**Mini-Assignments**: 
1. Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
2. Create a program that prints the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
3. Write a program that takes a positive integer `n` as input and prints all numbers from `n` down to 1 using a `while` loop.

### Functions

Functions group code into reusable blocks. Hereâ€™s how to define and use them:

```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int sum = add(5, 3);
    std::cout << "Sum is: " << sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Mini-Assignments**: 
1. Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the larger of the two.
2. Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number.
3. Write a program that asks for two numbers and uses a function to return their greatest common divisor (GCD).

## Getting Started

### Hello World

Your first C++ program!

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `#include <iostream>`: Includes the standard input/output stream library.
- `int main()`: Entry point of the program.
- `std::cout`: Outputs data to the console.
- `std::endl`: Inserts a newline character and flushes the stream.

### Basic Input/Output

Taking user input and displaying output.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int number;
    std::cin >> number;
    std::cout << "You entered: " << number << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
