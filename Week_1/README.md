## C++ Basics

### Intro to C++

#### Parts of Basic C++ Code

At its core, every C++ program contains a structure similar to this:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>                       // Preprocessor directive/Library
using namespace std;                           // Makes the program use the "Standard Namespace"

int main() {                                   // The main function where execution starts
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;           // Print statement
    return 0;                                  // End the program
}
```

**Breakdown**:
- `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This imports the library for every function you would need. Functions like the math functions, input/output functions, algorithms, string handling, etc.
- `using napespace std;`: This makes it so that you don't need to type `cout` and `endl` as `std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::end;`, its useful for simple/small programs, but not so much in larger programs as it might result in conflicts with other namespaces. 
- `int main()`: Every C++ program must have a `main` function, which is where the program starts executing.
- `cout`: Outputs data to the console. In this case, it's "Hello, World!" 
- `return 0`: Signals the end of the program.

#### Assignment
```markdown
1. Try programming in C++ by copying the "Hello, World!" C++ program (Don't Copy paste it! Type it, so that you start building muscle memory.) and change "Hello, World!" to "Welcome to C++!"
2. Modify what you did in #1 by adding another print statement that prints your name instead of "Hello, World!"
```

#### Input/Output

**Input** allows users to provide data, and **output** displays the results. In C++:
- `std::cout` is used for output.
- `std::cin` is used for input.

```cpp
#include <iostream>                                                 // Imports the library for Input/Output functions

int main() {
    int age;                                                        // Creates an integer variable called "age"
    std::cout << "Enter your age: ";                                // Prints "Enter your age:" and does not move on to the next line in the console
    std::cin >> age;                                                // Input stored in variable 'age'
    std::cout << "You are " << age << " years old." << std::endl;   // Prints "You are <inputted age> years old."
    return 0;                                                       // Signals the end of the program
}
```

**Mini-Assignments**: 
1. Create a program that takes a user's name and age, and then prints a message with this information.
2. Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

- [Basic I/O Practice Problems on HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/cpp-input-and-output/problem)

#### Variables

Variables store data, and arrays store multiple values of the same type.

**Basic Variables Example**:
```cpp
int x = 5;        // Integer
double y = 4.2;   // Floating-point number
char grade = 'A'; // Character
```

**Array Example**:
```cpp
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
std::cout << numbers[0]; // Access first element
```

**Mini-Assignments**: 
1. Write a program that declares variables of different types (e.g., `int`, `float`, `char`) and prints them.
2. Write a program that stores 5 different ages in an array and prints the average.
3. Create an array of 10 integers and print only the even numbers.

### Arrays

### Conditionals

Conditionals control the flow of a program based on certain conditions.

```cpp
int age = 20;
if (age >= 18) {
    std::cout << "You are an adult.";
} else {
    std::cout << "You are not an adult.";
}
```

**Mini-Assignments**: 
1. Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.
2. Create a program that takes in a student's score and prints their letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).
3. Write a program that asks for the user's age and tells them if they are eligible to vote (18 or older).

- [Conditional Statements Practice Problems](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/conditional-statements-in-c/problem)

---

### Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

**For Loop Example**:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    std::cout << "Loop iteration: " << i << std::endl;
}
```

**While Loop Example**:
```cpp
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    std::cout << "While loop iteration: " << i << std::endl;
    i++;
}
```

**Mini-Assignments**: 
1. Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
2. Create a program that prints the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
3. Write a program that takes a positive integer `n` as input and prints all numbers from `n` down to 1 using a `while` loop.

**Additional Practice**: 
- [C++ Loops](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/loops/)
- [Looping Practice Problems](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/for-loop-in-c/problem)

---

### Functions

Functions group code into reusable blocks. Hereâ€™s how to define and use them:

```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int sum = add(5, 3);
    std::cout << "Sum is: " << sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Mini-Assignments**: 
1. Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the larger of the two.
2. Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number.
3. Write a program that asks for two numbers and uses a function to return their greatest common divisor (GCD).

## Getting Started

### Hello World

Your first C++ program!

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `#include <iostream>`: Includes the standard input/output stream library.
- `int main()`: Entry point of the program.
- `std::cout`: Outputs data to the console.
- `std::endl`: Inserts a newline character and flushes the stream.

### Basic Input/Output

Taking user input and displaying output.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int number;
    std::cin >> number;
    std::cout << "You entered: " << number << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
