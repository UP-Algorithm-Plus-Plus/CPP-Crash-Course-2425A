### Introduction to C++

C++ is a powerful programming language used for a variety of applications, from system software to game development. In this guide, you'll learn the basics and get hands-on with coding right away.

---

#### Parts of Basic C++ Code

At its core, every C++ program contains a structure similar to this:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>                       // Preprocessor directive/Library
using namespace std;                           // Use the Standard Namespace

int main() {                                   // The main function where execution starts
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;           // Print statement
    return 0;                                  // End the program
}
```

**Breakdown**:
- `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This directive imports all standard libraries, covering a wide range of functions like math operations, input/output, algorithms, and string handling.
- `using namespace std;`: This allows you to write `cout` and `endl` without the `std::` prefix, which simplifies small programs but may cause conflicts in larger ones.
- `int main()`: Every C++ program must have a `main` function, which is the entry point where the program starts executing.
- `cout`: This is used to output text to the console. In this case, it prints "Hello, World!".
- `return 0;`: This signals the program has executed successfully and terminates it.

---

#### Assignment

1. Write the "Hello, World!" program yourself (type it manually for practice) and change the message to "Welcome to C++!". Then, compile and run it.
2. Modify your code by adding another `cout` statement to print your name. Try running the program again.

---

#### Input/Output

C++ allows interaction with the user through **input** and **output** operations:
- `cout` is used for output.
- `cin` is used for input.

```cpp
#include <iostream>   // Import the library for Input/Output

int main() {
    int age;                                                      
    std::cout << "Enter your age: ";                             // Prompt the user for input
    std::cin >> age;                                             // Store the input in the "age" variable
    std::cout << "You are " << age << " years old." << std::endl; // Output the result
    return 0;
}
```

When you run the code above, you'll see:

```
Enter your age:
```

After you type a number and press "Enter," the program will print your age in the format: `You are <inputted age> years old.`

---

#### Variables & Arithmetic Operators

Variables are placeholders that store different types of data. Here's an example:

```cpp
int x = 5;               // Integer variable initialized to 5

double y;                // Declare an empty double variable
y = 4.2;                 // Assign the value 4.2 to y

char grade = 'A';        // Character variable initialized with 'A'
```

Variables follow the format: `<data-type> <variable-name>;` or `<data-type> <variable-name> = <value>;`. You can declare a variable first and assign a value later, or initialize it immediately.

**Common Data Types**:
- `int`: Stores integers (e.g., `42`, `-3`).
- `float`: Stores single-precision floating-point numbers (e.g., `3.14`).
- `double`: Stores double-precision floating-point numbers with more accuracy than `float`.
- `char`: Stores a single character (e.g., `'A'`, `'3'`).
- `bool`: Stores boolean values (`true` or `false`).
- `string`: Stores sequences of characters (e.g., `"Hello!"`). Use with `#include <string>`.

---

**Basic Arithmetic Operators**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 5;
    int output;

    output = num1 + 3;   // Addition: output = 13
    output = num1 - num2;// Subtraction: output = 5
    output = num2 * 5;   // Multiplication: output = 25
    output = num1 / 2;   // Division: output = 5
    output = 11 % 5;     // Modulo: output = 1 (remainder of 11 / 5)

    return 0;
}
```

---

#### Assignment

1. Create a program that accepts two integers, A and B, then prints the results of A + B, A - B, A * B, A / B, and the remainder (A % B).
2. Write a program that declares variables of different types (`int`, `float`, `char`) and prints them.

#### Knowledge Check

These questions will test your understanding of the concepts:
- How do you output data to the console and accept user input in C++?
- How do you declare and initialize different types of variables in C++?

### Using `std::cin.peek()`

The `std::cin.peek()` function allows you to look at the next character in the input stream without extracting it. This can be useful when you need to make decisions based on the next character input.

**Example with `std::cin.peek()`**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    char nextChar;

    std::cout << "Enter a character: ";
    nextChar = std::cin.peek();    // Peek at the next character in the input buffer

    std::cout << "You entered: " << nextChar << std::endl;

    // Now extract the character so it doesn't affect future input
    std::cin >> nextChar;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `std::cin.peek();` returns the next character in the input stream without removing it from the buffer.
- This is useful if you want to check what the next character is before deciding how to process the input.

**Practical Use Case**:

Suppose you want to read input until the user enters a period (`.`). You can use `std::cin.peek()` to check if the next character is a period and stop reading when it is.

**Example**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    char ch;

    std::cout << "Enter characters (enter '.' to stop): ";

    while (true) {
        ch = std::cin.peek();    // Peek at the next character
        if (ch == '.') {
            break;               // Exit the loop if the next character is a period
        }
        std::cin >> ch;          // Extract the character from the buffer
        std::cout << ch << " ";
    }

    std::cout << std::endl << "Loop terminated due to '.' character." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:

- The program continuously peeks at the next character and checks if it's a period.
- If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
- Otherwise, it reads the character and processes it.
