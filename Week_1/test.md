### Introduction to C++

C++ is a powerful programming language used for a variety of applications, from system software to game development. In this guide, you'll learn the basics and get hands-on with coding right away.

#### Parts of Basic C++ Code

At its core, every C++ program contains a structure similar to this:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>                       // Preprocessor directive/Library
using namespace std;                           // Use the Standard Namespace

int main() {                                   // The main function where execution starts
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;           // Print statement
    return 0;                                  // End the program
}
```

**Breakdown**:
- `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This directive imports all standard libraries, covering a wide range of functions like math operations, input/output, algorithms, and string handling.
- `using namespace std;`: This allows you to write `cout` and `endl` without the `std::` prefix, which simplifies small programs but may cause conflicts in larger ones.
- `int main()`: Every C++ program must have a `main` function, which is the entry point where the program starts executing.
- `cout`: This is used to output text to the console. In this case, it prints "Hello, World!".
- `return 0;`: This signals the program has executed successfully and terminates it.

---

#### Assignment

1. Write the "Hello, World!" program yourself (type it manually for practice) and change the message to "Welcome to C++!". Then, compile and run it.
2. Modify your code by adding another `cout` statement to print your name. Try running the program again.

---

#### Input/Output

C++ allows interaction with the user through **input** and **output** operations:
- `cout` is used for output.
- `cin` is used for input.

```cpp
#include <iostream>   // Import the library for Input/Output

int main() {
    int age;                                                      
    std::cout << "Enter your age: ";                             // Prompt the user for input
    std::cin >> age;                                             // Store the input in the "age" variable
    std::cout << "You are " << age << " years old." << std::endl; // Output the result
    return 0;
}
```

When you run the code above, you'll see:

```
Enter your age:
```

After you type a number and press "Enter," the program will print your age in the format: `You are <inputted age> years old.`

#### Variables & Arithmetic Operators

Variables are placeholders that store different types of data. Here's an example:

```cpp
int x = 5;               // Integer variable initialized to 5

double y;                // Declare an empty double variable
y = 4.2;                 // Assign the value 4.2 to y

char grade = 'A';        // Character variable initialized with 'A'
```

Variables follow the format: `<data-type> <variable-name>;` or `<data-type> <variable-name> = <value>;`. You can declare a variable first and assign a value later, or initialize it immediately.

**Common Data Types**:
- `int`: Stores integers (e.g., `42`, `-3`).
- `float`: Stores single-precision floating-point numbers (e.g., `3.14`).
- `double`: Stores double-precision floating-point numbers with more accuracy than `float`.
- `char`: Stores a single character (e.g., `'A'`, `'3'`).
- `bool`: Stores boolean values (`true` or `false`).
- `string`: Stores sequences of characters (e.g., `"Hello!"`). Use with `#include <string>`.

---

**Basic Arithmetic Operators**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 5;
    int output;

    output = num1 + 3;   // Addition: output = 13
    output = num1 - num2;// Subtraction: output = 5
    output = num2 * 5;   // Multiplication: output = 25
    output = num1 / 2;   // Division: output = 5
    output = 11 % 5;     // Modulo: output = 1 (remainder of 11 / 5)

    return 0;
}
```

---

#### Assignment

1. Create a program that accepts two integers, A and B, then prints the results of A + B, A - B, A * B, A / B, and the remainder (A % B).
2. Write a program that declares variables of different types (`int`, `float`, `char`) and prints them.
