# C++ Crash Course Week 2 Part 0

## Overview

Welcome to **Week 2** of the C++ Crash Course! This week is designed to introduce you to time complexity and sorting algorithms. So I know you have opened this repo, say `hi rad!` to the general channel in the server discord. (mwahahaha)

### Topics We'll Cover:

- **Time Complexity**
  - The magic `100,000,000` number
  - How to estimate runtime?
- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

Refer to [Week 1](https://github.com/UP-Algorithm-Plus-Plus/CPP-Crash-Course-2425A/blob/main/Week_1/Part1.md) for frequently asked questions. You can also chat me(rad) on discord!
