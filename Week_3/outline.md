Part 1 ~ Static Arrays Extended
- Static Arrays (2 dimensional and 3 dimensional and nth dimensional). Introduce it to beginners and provide examples.
- Array (Class). Introduce it to beginners, how to work with it, provide examples.
- State time complexities for access, insert, delete, and search for Arrays


Part 2 ~ Dynamic Linear Data Structures
- Introduce Vectors and provide examples. State time complexity for access, insert, delete, and search for this data structure. 
- Introduce strings as vectors and talk about their time complexity (access, insert, delete, search)
- Introduce list (the class, the doubly linked list) and provide examples. Talk about their time complexity too at the end (access, insert, delete, search)
- Talk about auto iterators as ways to iterate thru strings, vectors, and lists
- Introduce stacks, queues, deques, provide examples for each and at the end put a table for their time complexity

Part 3 ~ Structures and Classes
- Introduce structures and classes in C++, provide examples. Talk about operator overloading. 

Part 4 ~ Linked lists
- Introduce doubly and singly linked lists. Provide examples. Put table for time complexity

Part 5 ~ Pairs and Tuples
- Introduce Pairs and Tuples. Provide examples.
