# Graphs

>A graph, usually denoted as $G=(V,E)$, is mathematically defined as collection of vertices $V$ and edges $E$. 
>- A **vertex** is a node associated with some concept; 
>- while an **edge** is a connection between two vertices which may be directed (one-way connection) or undirected (two-way connection). 
>- An edge may have a *weight* or *cost*, which is some value associated with traversing one endpoint vertex to another.

A linked-list can also be treated as a graph where the elements are the vertices and an edge is the pointer.
## Graph Terminologies

Let us first learn the following graph terminologies. Consider the following graph.

![](images/ExampleGraphTerminologies.png)
* Vertices `u` and `v` are **neighbors** if an edge `(u,v)` that connects them.
	- e.g. `neighbours[c] = {a,b,d}`
* The **degree** of a vertex `v` is the number of edges connected to vertex `v`.
	- e.g. `degree[c] = 3`
* A **path** is a sequence of vertices connected by edges. The **path length** is the number of edges in a path.
	- e.g. `f -> c -> d -> e` is a path of length 3
* A **cycle** is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
* Two vertices are **connected** if a path exists between them. A graph where all vertices are connected is a **connected graph**; otherwise the graph is a **disconnected graph**.
* A **connected component** is a subset of vertices that is connected. A connected graph has one connected component while a disconnected graph can have multiple connected components.
## Graph Types

Graph Types are differentiated by three properties. 
1. **Cyclic vs Acyclic Graph** - a graph is said to be acyclic if it contains a cycle and acyclic if otherwise.![](CyclicvsAcyclic.png)
2. **Directed vs Undirected Graph** - a graph is **directed** if the edges only connects vertices in one direction; otherwise, it is **undirected**.  ![](DirectedvsUndirected.png)In Graph Traversals, an undirected graph is usually interpreted as a **bidirectional** graph since you are not restricted in the direction of traversal.
3. **Weighted vs Unweighted Graphs** - a graph is **weighted** if there is a **cost assosciated** with an edge; it is **unweighted**, if otherwise.![](WeightedvsUnweightedGraph.png)

## Graph Code Representations

How do we present the following graph in code? ![](20241109120744.png)
There are three main ways in representing graphs in code.
1. Adjacency Matrix
2. Adjacency List
3. Edge List
### Adjacency Matrix
In an **adjacency matrix**, we represent the graph with a 2D array. Each cell `adj[i][j]` contains the weight of the edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`, or 0 (or a special value like `INF`) if there is no edge between them.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Number of vertices (5 vertices)
    int V = 5;
    
    // Create an adjacency matrix initialized to 0
    vector<vector<int>> adj(V, vector<int>(V, 0)); // Assuming no edge has weight 0

    // Add the edges with weights (directed graph)
    adj[0][2] = 4;  // Edge from 0 to 2 with weight 4
    adj[4][0] = 10; // Edge from 4 to 0 with weight 10
    adj[2][1] = 7;  // Edge from 2 to 1 with weight 7
    adj[3][1] = -1; // Edge from 3 to 1 with weight -1
    adj[2][3] = 19; // Edge from 2 to 3 with weight 19

    // Display the adjacency matrix
    cout << "Adjacency Matrix:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < V; j++) {
            cout << adj[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

It has the following representation.
```
Adjacency Matrix:
 0  0  4  0  0 
 0  0  0  0  0 
 0  7  0 19  0 
 0 -1  0  0  0 
10  0  0  0  0 
```

### Edge List

An **edge list** is just a vector of tuples in the form of `<source, destination, weight>`. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Edge list representation
    vector<tuple<int, int, int>> edges;

    // Add the edges (from, to, weight)
    edges.push_back({0, 2, 4});
    edges.push_back({4, 0, 10});
    edges.push_back({2, 1, 7});
    edges.push_back({3, 1, -1});
    edges.push_back({2, 3, 19});

    // Display the edge list
    cout << "Edge List:" << endl;
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        int u, v, w;
        tie(u, v, w) = edge; // Unpack the tuple
        cout << u << " -> " << v << " with weight " << w << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

It has the following output. 
```
Edge List:
0 -> 2 with weight 4
4 -> 0 with weight 10
2 -> 1 with weight 7
3 -> 1 with weight -1
2 -> 3 with weight 19
```

### Adjacency List
In an **Adjacency List**, Graphs can be represented as a mapping of vertices of the graph to the neighbors of each vertex(along with the weight if needed).
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Number of vertices (5 vertices)
    int V = 5;

    // Create an adjacency list (vector of pairs)
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(V);

    // Add the edges (from, to, weight)
    adj[0].push_back({2, 4});  // Edge from 0 to 2 with weight 4
    adj[4].push_back({0, 10}); // Edge from 4 to 0 with weight 10
    adj[2].push_back({1, 7});  // Edge from 2 to 1 with weight 7
    adj[3].push_back({1, -1}); // Edge from 3 to 1 with weight -1
    adj[2].push_back({3, 19}); // Edge from 2 to 3 with weight 19

    // Display the adjacency list
    cout << "Adjacency List:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
        cout << "Vertex " << i << ": ";
        for (auto& neighbor : adj[i]) {
            cout << "(" << neighbor.first << ", " << neighbor.second << ") ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

It has the following output.
```
Adjacency List:
Vertex 0: (2, 4) 
Vertex 1: 
Vertex 2: (1, 7) (3, 19) 
Vertex 3: (1, -1) 
Vertex 4: (0, 10) 
```


### When to use which??

- **Adjacency Matrix:**
    - Best for dense graphs (graphs with many edges).
    - Efficient for algorithms that need to quickly check if an edge exists between two vertices.
- **Edge List:**
    - Best for algorithms like **Kruskalâ€™s algorithm** (MST) or when you need to work with a list of edges directly.
    - Simple to implement and easy to sort.
- **Adjacency List:**
    - Best for sparse graphs where most vertices have few neighbors.
    - Space-efficient and useful for graph traversal algorithms like **DFS** and **BFS**.
